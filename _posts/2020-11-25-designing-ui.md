<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to AppGallery Connect, in the “My Apps” section, find “<b>Operate</b>” and <b>Game achievements</b>. Here you can add your personalized achievements and obtain their <b>achievementID</b>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you create an Achievement, its status will be seen as “<b>Testable</b>”. In this situation, unless you test the application with a “<b>Test Account</b>”, you won’t be able to access the achievements through the Game Service. If you release the achievements, it will be taken under the review and in this period, you won’t be able to do any changes on Achievements. Generally, this review won’t take so long and after the review, if Achievements get accepted by the review team, you will be able to use the achievements within your app as well as you will be able to edit previous achievements or add new achievements. <b>Please note that</b>, if you release an achievement, and it gets accepted by the review team, you won’t be able to delete that achievement again. You can only delete achievements which has not been released.</p>
